# Deferable

> Wrapper for promises to allow to defer the execution.

## Prerequisites

None. It only requires Promise capable version javascript interpreter.
e.g. Node version(8 and higher)

```sh
$ npm -v && node -v
6.4.1
v8.16.0
```

## Getting Started

clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:webduvet/promise-q.git
```
and from inside run the usual.
```sh
$ npm run test
$ npm run build
```

## Installation

**BEFORE YOU INSTALL:** please read the [prerequisites](#prerequisites)

It is standard npm package:

```sh
$ cd npm-project
$ npm install promise-q
```

## Usage

Inside your project:
```js
import {
    PromiseQ
} from 'promise-q'

const promiseArray = new Array(...new Array(50)).map(fnReturningPromise);

// 0.1s between calls and max 5 pending promises
const pq = new PromiseQ(promiseArray, 100, 5)

pq.start();
```

There is an example to be found in `/src/example/array-fn.js` which demonstrates throttling 50 asynchronous calls.

The promise-Q object is created with the constructor and it takes 3 arguments

`() => Promise<T>[]`
    array of functions returning Promise such as http call, REST call etc.

`Number`
    delay between individual calls, e.g. if spawning 50, 100 or 1000 calls at the same time is not desired.
    If not provided, the default value is 100 mls.

`Number`
    Queue or buffer size. This is the maximum number of currently pending Promises. Once this number is reached, the execution of the next function is paused until the at least one of the pending Promises is settled.
    If not provided the default value is undefined which means no limit on queue size.

`get PromiseQ.promises()`
    getter method to return the array of all promises

`PromiseQ.start()`
    starts the execution.

`PromiseQ.on(event, callback): unsubscribeFn`
    hook to register event. Library currently supports two events.
    - start: when the PromiseQ.start is triggerd
    - done: when all Promises are either `pending` or `settled`

    returns convenient *unsubscribe* function
    
    NOTE: if you require to run callback when all promises are settled you can just run
    `Promise.allSettled(pq.promises)`

`PromiseQ.off(event, callback)`
    unregister callback from an event. The same reference needs to be used.

### Running the tests

```sh
$ npm test
```

### Building a distribution version

```sh
$ npm run build
```

This task will create a distribution version of the project
inside your local `dist/` folder
