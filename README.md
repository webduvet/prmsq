## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

clone the repository and from inside run the usual
```sh
$ npm run test
$ npm run build
```

## Installation

**BEFORE YOU INSTALL:** please read the [prerequisites](#prerequisites)

Start with cloning this repo on your local machine:

```sh
$ cd npm-project
$ npm install promise-q
```

## Usage

Factory Flavor: **Defer**

This is a simple factory method returning a holder object for promise and the 

Inside your project:

```js
import {
    Defer
} from 'deferable'

const { result, ...lever } = Defer(function() {
    // returning the actual operation which returns promise e.g.
    return http.call(url)
    }, "result")


// passing a promise to where is it expected
consumerService(result)
...
// at some point in the code this triggers the promise fulfillment
lever.trigger()
```

It returns an object with three keys: `promise, trigger, called`;

    - first contains the actual promise which can be consumed.
    - trigger is a function which triggers the promise fulfillment.
    - called is a flag


Class flavor: **Deferred, DeferredTrigger**

In essence the class implementation of the above.
Objects `Deferred` and `DeferredTrigger` is typeof **Promise** should your project require this feature.

```js
import {
    DefferedTrigger
} from 'deferable';

const deferred = new Deferred(() => http.call(url))

// passing a promise to where is it expected
consumerService(deferred.promise)

// at some point in the code this triggers the promise fulfillment
deferred.trigger()
```

**Deferred** class is just a plain implementation of the deferred pattern exposing `resolve` and `reject` resolvers.


```js
import {
    Deffered
} from 'deferable';

const deferred = new Deffered()

// passing a promise to where is it expected
consumerService(deferred)

// at some point in the code this triggers the promise fulfillment
thanableService().then((data) => {
    deferred.resolve(data)
});
```

### Running the tests

```sh
$ npm test
```

### Building a distribution version

```sh
$ npm run build
```

This task will create a distribution version of the project
inside your local `dist/` folder
